To create an excessive cost alert on AWS, access the console with your root account (the email you used when you signed up AWS), click on **Services** at the top and filter the search for "cloudwatch" (service listed in **Management & Governance**).

On the side menu of the **CloudWatch** page, click on **Alarms**, and then create an alarm with the following settings:

* In the first step, select the **Billing** metric, click **Total Estimate Charge**, select the currency, and then click **Select metric**.

  Confirm that the verification period is 6 hours, the limit is **Static**, the currency value is _1_, and then proceed to the next step.

* In step 2 you configure the action that will be generated by the alarm.

  The trigger should be **In alarm**, select **Create new topic**, set the name to "admin_emails", register the email you want to receive a notification, create the topic, and then proceed to the next step.

* In the third step, provide the name and description of the alarm as "Alarm for Billing Outside Free Tier Usage", proceed to the last step, and then click **Create** to create the alarm.

* After returning to the alarm list, for a few minutes, the alarm created will display the status "**Insufficient data**". This is normal as it is necessary to collect metrics over a period of time.

The email registered in the created topic will receive a notification informing the registration in the alarm. Open the email and click Confirm Subscription to **confirm your subscription**.

Now every time your consumption of AWS resources exceeds the mark established in the alarm, you will receive a notification email alerting the high cost.
