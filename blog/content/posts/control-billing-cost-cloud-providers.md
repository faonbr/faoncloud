Although we will only work with "Free Tier" and "Always Free" features, it is important to set up billing alerts so that your monthly account in the cloud does not exceed a minimum amount.

This way, we avoid surprises if we use any resource that is outside the free tier.

For educational purposes, we will set up an email alert if the credit card account within the month exceeds the amount of US 1.00 (One dollar).

This value is merely an example. In some cases, you may find it comfortable to increase this threshold value. It's up to you.

Either way, you will be alerted by email if your spending exceeds the limit.

The links below present posts for each of the cloud services that we work on this Blog:
