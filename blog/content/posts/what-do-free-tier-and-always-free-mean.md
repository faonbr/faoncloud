The purpose of free services ("Free Tier" or "Always Free") is to provide users with a subset of services offered to companies, which are of low processing capacity but which can be useful for people to express their ideas.

In this way, the providers encourage people to put their ideas of applications, systems and services into practice and also retain their customers from the moment a new business is conceived.

For example, suppose you have an idea for a new business. As a good inventor you need to look for an investment for your business.

To put your idea into practice, it is necessary to put together a business plan to present to the investor. To get more attention from potential investors, you may be faced with the need to build a prototype.

A prototype can be created in the form of a presentation. But what if you create your prototype in the form of a system or service and make it available for public access over the internet?

In the past it would be impracticable to do this without having to bear several costs for hosting servers, services, domains, in addition to the development of the prototype system.

Today, with the advent of cloud computing, everything is easier. Current providers provide services that are affordable to the general public. What's more, these providers offer some services at no cost, allowing you to make your application or service available for free to the public.

In one way or the other, each cloud service provider makes its resources free to the public:

Using only this type of services we will discover how to make applications, services, websites available, free of charge forever or for a period.

This can help you to put your ideas into practice.
